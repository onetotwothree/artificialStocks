Artificial Stock Exchange with Accompanying Webpage

editse.py edits the sqlite3 database.

artificialse.py starts the program which simulates stocks and randomizes movements based on a weighting.

displayse.py runs a dash app on the localhost that allows you to visualize the stored data. Unfortunately the page must be refreshed or the "security" must be changed in the dropdown to update the new values on the website. This appears to be a limitation of using dash.
